Bug Fixes:

	- Bug where the game wouldn't check if an Entity was on the ground 
	if the gravity was turned off

	- Remade Jumping

	- Any lower value than 9 for gravity would not make gravity work

	- Mario gaining x axis velocity while in the air

	-

New Additions and changes:

	- Functional Jumping

	- Debug message tool

	- Adjusted Gravity on entities

	- Comments to remind myself (Author) what some code means

	- Made it so that the game no longer blocks the jump key when Mario hits something
	above his head but instead made it so that his velocity is set to 0 and his gravity is enabled

	- Changed sprite animation speed for bricks
