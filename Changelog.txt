Version 0.2.9

Bug Fixes:
- None

Additions and Changes:

- Complete Overhaul of graphics system and saving and loading system
(Note: Unfortunately there was a downside to the overhaul, old saves will be incompatible with new versions
if there's a lot of changes to the API specifically any API having to do with entities and tiles)

- Music is now loaded and changed differently (Using enums)

- Changed a bunch of objects to not be static anymore but become objects to combat static abuse

- Performance fixes
